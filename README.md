### Collaborators:
- `Favour Chibuike: @callmeKORRA03`
- `Stephen Omoregie: @Cr8steveDesign`



## Description 
The `printf` project is the first Group project undertaken by students of the Alx Software Engineering Program. It purpose as it has shown from our experience implementing the requirements for the task, is to solidify the knowledge of the C programming language by us students in the program. 

The printf function is one of the functions in the stdio.h header file. It is a very versatile tool and the most used function for printing to the STDOUT (Console/Terminal) in C. 

The goal of this project, was to teach us as Alx Students (Cohort 16) various skills including, but not limited to the inner Workings of various concepts of the C programming language, GitHub Collaboration, Project Planning, Problem Solving and Research.
