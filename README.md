## Take Note

- Kindly ensure that whichever sub-function you're implementing, for printing, they should return an integer. Which is a count of how many characters were succesfully printed. 

`You can declare a int count variable that will be incremented at every sucessful character write. And then return the count variable at the end of the function`
